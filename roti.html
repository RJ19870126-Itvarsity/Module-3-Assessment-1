                        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
                        <ul>                            
                            <li>1kg Cake Flour</li>
                            <li>2 tsp of salt </li>
                            <li>60ml sunflower oil</li>
                            <li>650-700ml cold water </li>
                            <li>200g soft butter or margarine</li>
                            <li>Extra flour for dishing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>METHOD</strong></p>
                        <p> Combine flour and salt in a bowl. Pour in some of the cold water and mix using your hands. Add the rest of the water, little by little. You may need between 650-700ml water. Mix into a soft dough.You can sprinkle flour and rub your hands together to remove sticky dough. Continue to knead...Add more flour if necessary. When finished kneading, let the dough rest for 30minutes.</p>
                        <p>Roll out the rested dough on a very lightly floured surface. Smear butter all over the rolled out dough and sprinkle with flour.Roll the dough into a thick rope. Dab the rope of dough with oil to prevent the dough drying out. Stretch the dough into a even longer rope. If you leave the dough to rest for 5-10 minutes it will be easier to stretch the dough.</p>
                        <p>Pull off pieces of the dough and gently stretch to mak individual rope, one side clockwise and the other anti-clockwise. Fold one half on top of the other. Continue to do this until all the dough is finished. Top each ball of dough with more oil. Place each ball in a plate to rest for 20 minutes, making sure they are covered with plastic wrap.</p>
                        <p>Roll out the balls to make circles(20cm in diameter). Place into a heated, heavy base pan. Fry both sides, flipping them over occasionally. You will notice the roti is puffing. Remove from pan and pat the roti between your palms to fluft</p>
                        <p>ENJOY!</p>
