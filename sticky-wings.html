                        <ul>                            
                            <li>2 Large Baking Sheets</li>
                            <li>1 Cooling Rack</li>
                            <li>1 Pastry Brush</li>
                            <p><strong>Prep Work</strong></p>
                            <p>Preheat the oven to 375°F</p>
                            <p>Season the chicken wings with the salt, garlic powder and pepper.</p>
                            <p><strong>Bake the chicken wings</strong></p>
                            <p>Spray a baking sheet lightly with cooking spray. Place the chicken wings, in a single layer, on the baking sheet. Bake them for 30 minutes.</p>
                            <p>Remove the wings from the oven. Line a clean baking sheet with a cooling rack. The cooling rack will elevate the wings and allow air to circulate around them.</p>
                            <p>Spray the cooling rack lightly with cooking spray. Arrange the chicken wings, in a single layer, on the cooling rack, skin side up. Bake the chicken wings for 15 minutes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Make the Sticky Barbecue Sauce</strong></p>
                            <p>While the wings continue to cook, make the sticky barbecue sauce.
                            Add the barbecue sauce, brown sugar, honey, ketchup, mustard and Worcestershire sauce to a saucepan. Heat the barbecue sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid sticking.</p>
                            <p>Simmer the sauce for a few minutes, until the sugar melts and the ingredients are incorporated. Give the sauce all of your attention while it’s simmering! Do not leave the pan unattended.

Lower the heat to low and keep the sauce warm until ready to use, stirring occasionally.

Add about ¾ of the sauce to a bowl and reserve the rest for serving.</p>
                            <p><strong>Coat the wings with the barbecue sauce</strong></p>
                            <li>Remove the wings from the oven and turn each one so the paler side is up.</li>
                            <li>Use a pastry brush to coat them with a generous amount of the barbecue sauce and bake for another 5 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Again, remove them from the oven and turn each wing. Brush them with a thick layer of the sauce. You basically want to slather it on.</li>
                            <li>Return the wings to the oven and bake another 5 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Without turning them this time, sauce them one final time and bake for another 5 minutes.</li>
                            <p>Arrange the wings on a platter serve them with the remaining barbecue sauce on the side. Oh, and make sure to serve the sticky chicken wings with lots of napkins and enjoy!</p>
