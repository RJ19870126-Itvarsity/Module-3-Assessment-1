                            <li>11.5 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                            <p><strong>Special Equipment:</strong></p>
                            <li>27 in x 13 in baking dish</li>
                            <li>A cheese grater is needed to shred your own cheese.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>METHOD</strong></p>
                        <p>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook macaroni according to the package instructions, until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Beat eggs in a large bowl until they get frothy. Add evaporated milk and stir. Pour in half & half and keep mixing until blended well.
Add shredded cheese to the mixture, but reserve 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar and 1/2 cup of Monterey jack cheese for later.
Gently fold in cooked macaroni into the cheesy milk mixture. Season with salt and black pepper, and any additional seasonings if using. Stir until well-coated.
Spray baking dish with non-stick cooking spray or grease with butter, then transfer mac and cheese to greased dish.
Sprinkle reserved sharp cheddar and Monterey jack cheese on top of the macaroni.
Bake at 350°F, uncovered, for about 40 minutes, or until it is golden and bubbly.
Allow it to sit for 10-15 minutes before serving so that it can settle and thicken.</p>
